/Users/diveroidteam/Desktop/Ravi/ionic-angular/unity-ionic/unity/ArTreasureHuntLibrary/launcher/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:4: Warning: <supports-screens> tag appears after <application> tag [ManifestOrder]
  <supports-screens android:smallScreens="true" android:normalScreens="true" android:largeScreens="true" android:xlargeScreens="true" android:anyDensity="true" />
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ManifestOrder":
   The <application> tag should appear after the elements which declare which
   version you need, which features you need, which libraries you need, and so
   on. In the past there have been subtle bugs (such as themes not getting
   applied correctly) when the <application> tag appears before some of these
   other elements, so it's best to order your manifest in the logical
   dependency order.

/Users/diveroidteam/Desktop/Ravi/ionic-angular/unity-ionic/unity/ArTreasureHuntLibrary/launcher/build.gradle:30: Warning: Missing x86_64 ABI support for ChromeOS [ChromeOsAbiSupport]
            abiFilters "arm64-v8a"
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ChromeOsAbiSupport":
   To properly support ChromeOS, your Android application should have an x86
   and/or x86_64 binary as part of the build configuration. To fix the issue,
   ensure your files are properly optimized for ARM; the binary translator
   will then ensure compatibility with x86. Alternatively, add an abiSplit for
   x86 within your build.gradle file and create the required x86
   dependencies.

/Users/diveroidteam/Desktop/Ravi/ionic-angular/unity-ionic/unity/ArTreasureHuntLibrary/launcher/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/app_icon_round.xml:2: Warning: The resource R.mipmap.app_icon_round appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

/Users/diveroidteam/Desktop/Ravi/ionic-angular/unity-ionic/unity/ArTreasureHuntLibrary/launcher/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/app_icon.png: Warning: Launcher icons should not fill every pixel of their square region; see the design guide for details [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your
   launcher icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional,
   front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that
   users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

/Users/diveroidteam/Desktop/Ravi/ionic-angular/unity-ionic/unity/ArTreasureHuntLibrary/launcher/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/app_icon.xml:2: Warning: The application adaptive icon is missing a monochrome tag [MonochromeLauncherIcon]
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "MonochromeLauncherIcon":
   If android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in your manifest, you must
   either remove the reference to android:roundIcon if it is not needed; or,
   supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the android:roundIcon
   and android:icon attribute.

   For example, if android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in the
   manifest, a launcher might choose to use android:roundIcon over
   android:icon to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed
   application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also
   specified in android:roundIcon.
